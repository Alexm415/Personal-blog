# Personal-blog

The personal Blog project was really a challenge to understand the localstorage and see how to move items from it to the next page. It was fun seeing it work as it should, and making something out of nothing.

## User experiance

When the user in puts their info to the boxes it than displays them in another page with the other blog post. If the user does not provide anything the page will display a error message so that the user can put content in and use the blog post page.

## Credits

The Xpert learning assistant help me see why the code was not working as it should. Office hours help me alot with this work.
